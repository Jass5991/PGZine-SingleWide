Simple Python Script to convert double-wide Patient Gamer magazine to Single-Wide for Phones and e-ink readers

A really basic script to do one thing well enough: Convert double wide pages in PDFs from online magazines into single pages by cutting it down the middle.
To avoid issues, its advised to keep only one PDF in the input folder. In the event that there is more than one file, it will take the last item in the list,
however that sorting may be.

If I return to this I might resolve that minor thing, but otherwise it is what it is. Enjoy!
